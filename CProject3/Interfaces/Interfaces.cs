#region Interfaces
//What is an Interface?
//A language that is similar to a class(in terms of syntax)
//BUT is fundamentally different

//Declaring an Interface 
//Notice that the Interface's Name starts with an "I"
//This is proper convention

//public interface ITaxCalculator
//{
//    int Calculate();
